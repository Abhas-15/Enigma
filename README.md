# Inspiration
Have you ever wanted to land upon a website that not only answers all your puzzling questions about space but also adds new dimensions to your understanding of the Universe? There is an infinite pool of knowledge waiting to be passed down. What if there was a fun and enchanting way of learning physics, chemistry, astronomy, and mathematics? Well, we are here to your rescue. ðŸš€
We are as passionate as you to get educated most excitingly and interactively, and hence we have built this website. Enigma provides you with an exhilarating experience through the mysteries of the Universe, all while making you more curious and hungry for more!

# How did we built it?
We used Three.js to add three-dimensional effects that can resonate with the viewers' imagination of the Universe.
Further, in each snippet, one can directly navigate to the editorial page, which has a spectrum of detailed articles covering almost all topics one might be interested in. This Editorial page is built with HTML, CSS, and js.

# Challenges
Three.js was a completely new topic for us. Neither of us was experienced with adding animation, light and camera, 3D positioning, and many such concepts involving 3D effects. We had to learn about 3D designing and coding with three.js. We took the help of the documentation available on the three.js website https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene. We also referred to various examples available in the three.js website and youtube tutorials.

# Accomplishments we are proud of
We are proud of what we could finally develop using a relatively new concept and skill. We could use our basic javascript knowledge to make our website more interesting so that viewers read and learn through it, which is one of our essential inspirations. Apart from that, we could use our HTML and CSS skills to create an engrossing editorial page.

# Future Prospectives
 "Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young." Hence, we do not want to limit either ourselves or our audience. We plan to enhance our website's SEO, UI/UX, content, and quality. We also plan to add more features to our website, all with the goal of making learning about astronomy and the Universe fun and interesting.

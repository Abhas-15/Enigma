        <h2>üï≥Ô∏è Black Hole</h2>

        <h3>Does time exist in a black hole?</h3>
        <p>
          The singularity at the center of a black hole is the ultimate no man's land: 
          a place where matter is compressed down to an infinitely tiny point, 
          and all conceptions of time and space completely break down.
          And it doesn't really exist.
          
          <h3>Who named it as "black hole"?</h3>
          In December 1967, a student reportedly suggested the phrase "black hole" at a lecture by  John Wheeler.
          Wheeler adopted the term for its brevity and "advertising value", and it quickly caught on,
          leading some to credit Wheeler with coining the phrase.
          <br/>
          "Calling these things black holes was a master stroke,‚Äù Stephen Hawking,

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ   Why does gravity only pull?</h2>
        <p>
          All the other forces in nature have opposites. In the case of the electromagnetic force, for example, it can attract or repel, depending on the charges of the bodies involved. So what makes gravity different?

          "...Because relativity does not rule out the possibility that
          the bent space-time that gives rise to gravity‚Äôs pull can be ‚Äúunbent‚Äù. 
           By appropriate arrangements, it should be possible to diminish ‚Äì 
          or enhance ‚Äì the influence of gravity,‚Äù

      	This distance, where it is not too hot and not too cold for liquid water, 
        is called the ‚Äúhabitable‚Äù or ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù zone. 
        Astronomers are interested in worlds that orbit 
        within that zone because liquid water is essential 
        for life as we know it.A team of astronauts had announced the discovery of one such planet, GJ 357d, 
        and led the work on characterising it. 
        The star it orbits, which lies in the constellation of Hydra, 
        is 31 light years away ‚Äî relatively close, given our galaxy‚Äôs 100,000-light-year diameter.

        <h3>Life cycle of Stars</h3>
        <p>
          Stars are born within the clouds of dust.
          A familiar example of such as a dust cloud is the Orion Nebula.
          As the cloud collapses, a dense, hot core forms and begins gathering dust and gas. 
          Not all of this material ends up as part of a star ‚Äî 
          the remaining dust can become planets, asteroids, or comets or may remain as dust.
          <br/>
          In general, the larger a star, the shorter its life, 
          although all but the most massive stars live for billions of years.

        <h2>‚öõÔ∏è Dark Matter- the stuff of science fiction or reality?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the biggest mysteries in physics today is dark matter. 
          This is the name given to the 85% of matter in the galaxies whose existence 
          can be inferred but which gives off no direct signs of any kind, including light.
          <br/>
          In a recent study, physicists wondered whether the mysterious dark matter could actually 
          consist of plain old antimatter, 
          because, well, there is nothing that would in principle prevent this. 
          But if these chunks of antimatter are found in the sky, 
          couldn‚Äôt some of them fall to Earth as meteorites and hit people? The researchers thought of that.
          Being struck by an antimatter lump would probably look like a gunshot that also gave you extreme radiation poisoning.
          However no such mentions have appeared in the media in at least the past ten years. 
          <br/>
          The familiar material of the universe, known as baryonic matter, 
          is composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. Dark matter may be made of baryonic or non-baryonic matter. 
          The missing matter could simply be more challenging to detect, made up of regular, baryonic matter.

        <h2>üí• THE FIRST SECOND, AND THE BIRTH OF LIGHT - THE BIG BANG</h2>

        <h3>What is the Big Bang?</h3>
        <p>
          To modern cosmologists, the Big Bang is a model describing how the universe 
          expanded from an extremely hot, dense early state into the reality that we see today. 
          The evidence for this interpretation is overwhelming. Certainly, nothing else has 
          come anywhere close in the last 50 years, even as our knowledge about the universe has grown tremendously.
          <br/>
          For anyone wondering how the universe could have formed from an explosion at one point in space, 
          the answer is that it couldn‚Äôt. 
          That idea truly is wrong ‚Äî but it is also not at all what the Big Bang describes.
